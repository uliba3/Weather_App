# Weather App README

## Overview

The Weather App is a simple web application that allows users to check the current weather for a specific location. Users can input a location, such as a city or town, and the app will provide them with weather-related information, including temperature, humidity, wind direction, and more.

## Features

The Weather App includes the following features:

1. **Location Search**: Users can input a location in a text field and click the "search" button to retrieve weather data for that location.

2. **Dynamic Weather Data**: The app fetches real-time weather data from an external API (WeatherAPI) and displays it on the page.

3. **Temperature Conversion**: Users can toggle between Celsius (°C) and Fahrenheit (°F) to view the temperature in their preferred unit.

4. **Wind Information**: The app displays wind direction and speed in both kilometers per hour (kph) and miles per hour (mph). Users can toggle between these units as well.

5. **Weather Icon**: An icon representing the current weather condition is displayed alongside the weather information.

## Usage

To use the Weather App, follow these steps:

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

2. Enter the location (e.g., city, town) in the "Location" input field.

3. Click the "search" button.

4. The app will retrieve and display weather information for the specified location.

5. To switch between temperature units (Celsius and Fahrenheit) or wind units (kph and mph), simply click on the respective unit label.

## Development

If you want to contribute to the development of the Weather App or customize it for your needs, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-app.git
   ```

2. Open the project folder in your code editor.

3. Customize the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files as needed.

4. You can modify the external API used for weather data by changing the API endpoint in the `main.js` file. Update the `fetch` URL to use your preferred weather data provider.

5. Test your changes by opening the `index.html` file in a web browser.

6. Once you're satisfied with your changes, you can deploy the app to a web server or hosting service of your choice.

## External Dependencies

The Weather App relies on the following external dependencies:

- **WeatherAPI**: The app uses the WeatherAPI to fetch real-time weather data. You will need to obtain an API key from WeatherAPI and replace the key in the `fetch` URL in the `main.js` file.
